////////// WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO FIND HERE//////////
PinCode shows a view like the iOS generic autentication pinpad.
This project is able to work on both platforms, Iphone and Ipad, but in this demo, we show Ipad version only. 
PinCode view supports landscape and portrait mode.

As a demo, you can choose the correct password at the beginning.

PinCode is a simple view to use as a Code Entry.

////////// HOW TO USE IT //////////
This project contains a simple ViewController and a Delegate Method.

Add the files to your project and call the method PinCode to make it work:

   PinCode pinCodeVC=[[PinCode alloc] initWithNibName:@"PinCode" bundle:nil];
   [pinCodeVC setDelegate:self];
   [pinCodeVC.view setFrame:frame];
   [self.view addSubview:pinCodeViewController.view];
